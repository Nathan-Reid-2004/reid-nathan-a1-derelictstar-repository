This is a repository containing all work &amp; documents related to Assignment 1 for GAME-10003-02. Derelict Star is a text-based survival horror game created specifically for this assignment.

The main gameplay loop of Derelict Star consists of exploring a starship's medical bay in the year 2192. The player can go either NORTH, WEST, or EAST after emerging from their cryo chamber- there are different outcomes depending on where the player chooses to go, and there is only one correct outcome from the three choices.

Enemy encounters also play a big role in the gameplay. There are two weapons which can be used- each weapon does a specific amount of damage. During the enemy encounter, the player must be observant and use critical thinking (as well as trial/error) to figure out the most optimal way to go about combat- there is only one solution, meaning the encounter is like that of a puzzle. 

Players can also heal and use strength boosters. Strength boosters add an extra 3 hit points to weapon damage, and medical patches heal the player by 3 hit points. 

At the end of the game, as long as the player survives the combat encounter (and the various deaths that can occur even before the enemy shows up), they will have to put a code into the north door of the medical bay. This will give them access to the escape pod garage where they can escape the clearly doomed ship. 

*Note: This game was originally intended to be much larger than this and with far more content (this is fairly evident in my previous commits and especially my process work). After realizing I was being far too ambitious, I had to cut most content from the game, which is why it may seem bare in comparison to what I had planned.*
